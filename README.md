# Issues

Please use the issues tab to report any errors with the translation/typesetting etc.

We have a couple of tags to help distinguish between the types of issues:
- translation: any translation issues or improvements
- typesetting: typesetting / sfx issues
- platform: problems with the site or any software
- request: feature requests or requests for manga to be translated

For issues with specific chapters, have the issue title in something like the following format:
```
[manganame] [chapter]: [issue title]
```

It would also be nice to include page and panel numbers, as well as a screenshot of the issue. You can also provide possible fixes if you want.

Thanks for your help!
